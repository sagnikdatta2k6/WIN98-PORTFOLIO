## 📖 About The Project

This project is a frontend portfolio website that mimicks the look and feel of a classic Windows operating system. The iconic "Bliss" wallpaper combined with a retro taskbar and pixelated icons provides an engaging way for visitors to explore my professional background.

Instead of standard navigation bars, users interact with desktop icons to "launch" different sections of my portfolio.
